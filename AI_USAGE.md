# AI Usage Documentation

This document outlines how Artificial Intelligence tools were utilized as learning aids and development assistants during the creation of this project.

## Tools Used
* **Gemini 3 pro (Web Interface):** Primary thought partner for architecture design, OOP structure, and debugging.
* **ChatGPT 5.2:** Used for refining the Project Proposal and enhancing documentation clarity.
* **GitHub Copilot:** Used as an autocomplete assistant for boilerplate code and standard function definitions.

## Ethical Usage & Learning
In alignment with the course guidelines, AI was used for the following "Good Uses":

1. **Architecture & Design:** I consulted Gemini to help structure the project into a professional modular format (`src/`, `notebooks/`, `results/`), moving from a single script to an Object-Oriented approach.
2. **Debugging & Troubleshooting:** AI assisted in resolving Git branch conflicts (`master` vs `main`) and debugging path issues when saving results to specific directories.
3. **Learning New Libraries:** I used AI to learn the specific syntax of `XGBoost` and to understand how to implement `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Documentation Writing:** AI helped format the documentation to ensure professional standards.
5. **Code Review:** I provided snippets of my code to the AI to ask for suggestions on efficiency and readability (e.g., refactoring the `HousingModel` class).

## Accountability
I strictly adhered to the "Not Acceptable" rules:
* **Deep Understanding:** I do not submit any code that I do not understand. Every function, from the data loader to the XGBoost evaluation, has been reviewed and tested by me.
* **Student-Led Development:** While AI assisted with specific tasks, the overall project vision, the choice of the `hprice3` dataset, the research question, and the final synthesis were entirely directed by me.
